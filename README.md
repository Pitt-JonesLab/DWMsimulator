# DWM simulator
## A Spintronic Processing-In-Memory Simulator for Racetracks {**SPIMulator**}.



### Project Setup:
* The SPIMulator was written in python version 3.8.
* SPIMulator does not require any exterrnal pip downloads. It can run in itself after download. 
* SPIMulator.py is the main file where we read the intruction(.text) files. So, the instruction files needs to be initialized here every time we run a new algorithm.
